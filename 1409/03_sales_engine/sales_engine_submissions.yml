      notes: "Application fulfills all base expectations as tested by the spec harness.
             Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.
             Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.
             Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
             Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods."

      notes: "Well-tested in isolation and w/ mocks for repos and sales engine. Would like to see tests for sales engine logic. 
              All but three tests passing in spec harness.
              Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
              Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods.
              Zero complaints for rake sanitation."
