## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- Bird is consistently trying to fly above the lava.
- If the player does nothing, the bird will drop into the lava.
- If the player types quickly and correctly the numbers that are appearing on the screen, the bird will stay above the lava.
- If the player has too many errors, types slowly or not at all, the bird will fall into the lava.
- If the player finishes typing a sequence of letters without the bird falling into the lava, they move onto the next level.
- Levels increase in complexity by the length of the text that they have to type, making lava grow and/ or making the bird fall faster.
- Player accumulates point and the game gets harder and harder and goes on forever...
- Two player mode where players compete for highest score.


### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

- Bird is consistently trying to fly above the lava.
- If the player does nothing, the bird will drop into the lava.
- If the player types quickly and correctly the numbers that are appearing on the screen, the bird will stay above the lava.
- If the player has too many errors, types slowly or not at all, the bird will fall into the lava.
- If the player finishes typing a sequence of letters without the bird falling into the lava, they move onto the next level.
- Levels increase in complexity by the length and/or complexity of the text that they have to type.
- Player accumulates point and the game gets harder and harder and goes on for six levels.

### What have you accomplished so far?
- Starter kit and Git repo set up
- Render two canvases; one on top of other
- Build initial code for determining whether letter is correct or not
- See something happening on two canvases by firing one function
- Pseudocode for bird points created
- Waffle.io setup
- Have six texts compiled. (Use every letter in alphabet, different language, lorem impsom)
- DTR
- Drawn wireframe
