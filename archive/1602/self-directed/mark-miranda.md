  - Really clean UI - nice touches with ajax and low key color implementation
  - 99% Test coverage = all levels tested with sad paths
  - Awesome use of AJAX
  - Obvious developer spent a lot of time doing user research and testing for interface bugs
  - Complex views but learned a lot by implementing unique ways to iterate over information
  - Could use some refactoring with large methods and partials in views
