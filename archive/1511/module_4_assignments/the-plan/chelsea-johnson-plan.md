### Which Assignments and Why?
- Which assignments did you choose to complete this week?
 - I chose to work on goals and job hunt. 
- Why did you choose these assignments?
 - The goals are great for keeping me motivated to learn new technologies, while the job hunt assignment helped me to investigate good jobs in a structured manner. 

### Submitted Assignments

#### 1-Goals

##### Identify

Understand React
 - I have created a couple applications with React, but I feel like I do not have a very thorough understanding of the framework.
 - In a year, I hope to be able to write a React app quickly without looking at documentation for each step and have a conceptual command of the framework.
 - Resources for learning
  - I will finish the React for Beginner tutorial and use Lovisa as a resource. I will also refer to the Facebook documentation often.
 and by building a React sample app that displays cat pictures.
  - Using React, I would like to build a cat picture app where users can post pictures and comment on pictures. Would like require a Rails back end.
  - I could give a lightning talk about sending information between React components.
  - I would like to attend a ReactJS meetup.
  - I could also contribute to open source projects, like this [calculator app](https://github.com/benoitvallon/react-native-nw-react-calculator).
 - This goal is important to me because I want to understand the most popular JS frameworks so I am more employable.

Data Structures and Algorithms
- This is one of my weaker CS areas. I have a difficult time conceptualizing complex algorithms and data structures.
- Success would include understanding more data structures (e.g., BST, linked list, stack, set, queues) and big O notation.
- Resources for learning
  - Resources include exercisms and resources listed [here](https://gist.github.com/julsfelic/ce5f238955e71271ec3c8c4ae2d3ec0a).
  - My husband is a great resource for data structures and algorithms so I can discuss questions with him.
  - I will create a DSA repo to work on.
  - I could contribute to [this](https://github.com/patmorin/ods) open source project.
  - I could also give a lightning talk that discusses a common data structure.
- This goal is important to me, because DSA questions are often asked in interviews, and I want to be a well-rounded computer scientist.

Java
- I would like to learn Java. I have never written Java, so it would be a new language for me.
- In a year, I would like to know the syntax of Java and have created an Android app.
- Resources for learning
  - I would like to complete the Code Academy lesson and do Java exercisms.
  - I could talk to mentors with traditional CS degrees to learn more.
  - I could talk about setting up an Android app for a lightning talk.
  - I could contribute to [this](http://java-source.net/open-source/chat-servers/freecs) open source chat project.
- This goal is important to me, because I have wanted to create an Android app for a while and Java is a very popular language.

##### Define

For each goal:
  - State where you are currently at with this goal
    - e.g. 'I have given a lightning talk on Go', 'I downloaded EMACS', 'I am at an intermediate level with JavaScript'
  - Define what success looks like after 1 year
  - Outline resources for learning
    - List books, blogs, talks, podcasts and courses that would be useful in learning more
    - List mentors you know or places you could find mentors who could help you along the way
        - List meetups and conferences related to this goal (if relevant)
    - List ideas or links to things you could or are currently building to achieve this goal. (check out the side-hustle assignment)
    - List ideas for lightning talks or conference talks that you could give on this topic. (check out the community involvement assignment)
    - List open source projects that relate to this goal (check out the open source assignment)
  - Why is this goal important to you?


#### 2-Job Hunting

  - Tech stack is Rails and JS, which I am familiar with
  - Could not find any meetups they support, but the Boulder Ruby Group would be a good meetup to attend.
  - A Glassdoor post about their tech interviews didn't go into specifics about the process, just stated you meet with recruiter, VP of engineering, and the team you would work with.
  - pros
    - Good reviews for most part
    - In Boulder, remote options
    - Good benefits
  - cons
    - One reviewer stated engineers that don't fit the white/male archetype don't do well.
