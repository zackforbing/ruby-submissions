## Completion

### Do You Consider the Application to be Fully Playable?

 - Yes, though it feels like we could work on the project for a year, and maybe be finished - there's always more features to add. There are some minor playability issues: mostly styling - it could be clearer to the user what is happening and to whom (level transitions, who which scores belong to in 2 player mode, etc.)

### What Extensions, as Requested By an Instructor, Did You Complete?

* Two player mode  
* Moving app to Express

### What Features, if Any, Do You Feel Exceed Instructor Expectations?

-I'm not totally clear on what extensions were "required" vs. not. Those mentioned above were beyond the scope of the project spec.

## Risk Taking

- What risks did you feel you took on this project?

The project concept in general was more complicated than it needed to be to meet base project requirements - with a lot of moving pieces. The two most challenging pieces were creating a jump that looked natural (there are a lot of "phases" to the jump with different behavior in each of them), and not allowing him to walk through the vertical walls in level three. (Most collision looked for general overlap, while that required specific left:right edge and right:left edge collision).

- How do you feel about those risks?

Good. I think we would have gotten bored if we hadn't taken them. However, our code quality did suffer in order to complete the features we did, and has more redundancy than we would like.

## Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of

[A jumping dinosaur](https://github.com/adriennedomingus/bubble_bobble/blob/3d2ca8d69921d6b3f05d6f49bb7a9b577d69bf6e/lib/dinosaur.js#L119-L129)
- Why were you proud of this piece of code?

All of the logic has been pulled out into small, reusable pieces of code, that makes this specific block very human-readable. It is clear what is going on in each branch of the flow control

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about

[The Game Play Class](https://github.com/adriennedomingus/bubble_bobble/blob/3d2ca8d69921d6b3f05d6f49bb7a9b577d69bf6e/lib/game.js)

I would argue that this is less than our best showing in general. It was in significantly better shape before we added two-player mode, which introduced a host of duplication. Since that happened so late, we didn't have the opportunity to refactor we might have liked.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

### Test Breakdown
- How Many Unit Tests?

43

- How Many Feature/Integration Tests?

I'm going to go with zero.

### Provide a link to an example, if you have one, of a unit test that covers an 'edge case' or 'unhappy path'

## Instructor Feedback

- Points: (base 300)
- 
150 out of a total of 300 points are included in the rubric below. The additional 150 feature points will be determined during iteration planning with instructors during check-ins.

### Functional Expectations
* **35 points** - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expecations set by instructors

### User Interface
* **15 points** - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing
* **25 points** - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style
* **20 points** - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow
* **25 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…
* **15 points** - Zero complaints

### TOTAL POINTS
 - ChekIns: 155
 - Subtotal: 145
 - Extensions: 10
 - **Total: 310**
