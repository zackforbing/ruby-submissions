Notes:
* 16 tests total, some were not passing
* Look for some more edge case testing.
* Count method was close to completion, insert, and pop weren't working
* Code was split out and separated well, no method was doing too much.

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
