Notes:

* good testing overall, could use more sad path tests, refactour out duplicate setups
* nice use of recursion and looping
* very neat code, easy to read and understand
* with attr's, no need to use the @ sign in your program (unless we are setting the value, need to prepend with `self.1)
* `#insert` is the only method that's in need of some TLC (refactour out left/right)

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions
* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations
*** 2: Application is missing one base expectation**
* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
*** 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality**
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
*** 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP**
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
*** 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring**
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

*** 4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques**
* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
* 2: Application has issues with loop/recursion techniques or mixes them inappropriately
* 1: Application struggles to loop/recurse at all
