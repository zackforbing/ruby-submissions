Assessed By: Mike

Github: http://github.com/gregoryarmstrong/http

Notes:

* 44 tests
* i 1-3 complete, 4 does not completely work
* Some longer methods with opportunities to refactor for clarity and simplicity,
specifically in methods with long complex conditionals, and try to avoid writing methods
that modify an instance variable, as opposed to accepting a parameter and returing a value

Notes:

* Some initial progress on a procedural solution the problem
* Struggled to make layered progress on problem components, largely
due to difficulties in applying dev processes and techniques
* Struggled with outpacing feedback - no tests to provide feedback,
seems to have led to difficulty understanding the progress that had
been made thus far and the scope of the problem

Scores:

* Overall Functionality 1: Application implements two or fewer iterations
* Fundamental Ruby & Style 2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
* Test-Driven Development 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD
* Breaking Logic into Components 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

Github: https://github.com/brantwellman/Turing-HTTP-Yeah-You-Know-Me

Notes:

* Good organization overall at the high level
* Some methods could use some love in terms of breaking apart
the logic and steps
* Test coverage is thorough and does a good job of dealing with
clear inputs and outputs
* Some portions of the project are lacking in tests and it very clearly
shows in the structure of the corresponding code

Notes:

* 25 tests,

with postman/whatever

unnecessary variable assignment

## JP & Steve O

Group: JP & Steve O

Assessed By: Horace

Github: https://github.com/jwperry/5project_repo

Notes:

* Good functionality hitting up to I5
* Testing is good; using relatively clear inputs and outputs
to test the logic in isolation of the HTTP server
* Don't love the rigid approach to parsing body vs. headers;
leads to some weird behavior if you use different clients or browsers
* Also would have simplified test data if we were able to take a different
approach to parsing the inputs
* Overall abstraction of Server class to handle responsibilities is good,
but there are other tasks that could have been split out of it -- esp.
Path/Action identification; Response generation and formatting; actual
action performance
* Testing covers main paths and usage pretty well but didn't turn up some
prominent edge-cases

Scores:

* Overall Functionality 3: Application implements four iterations
* Fundamental Ruby & Style 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
* Test-Driven Development 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.
* Breaking Logic into Components 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

## Penney

Group: Penny

Assessed By: Horace

Github: https://github.com/PenneyGadget/http_yeah_you_know_me

Notes:

* Solid functionality through I3
* Starting on a good attempt toward class extraction and
refactoring, but the extraction is not totally complete so
we end up with duplicated responsibilities between various classes
* More diagramming / sketching / dependency tracking / state examination
(what classes rely on each other; what instance variables are being tracked in
each object)
* Testing is pretty lacking -- might have been helpful to focus on stripping down
overall functionality into cleaner inputs/outputs that could be tested more
granularly
* Kudos being alone for the project and struggling through the many unknowns

Scores:

* Overall Functionality 2: Application implements three iteration
* Fundamental Ruby & Style 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
* Test-Driven Development 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD
* Breaking Logic into Components 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility

## Steve and Emily

Group: Steve and Emily

Assessed By: Horace

Github: https://github.com/emblou2/http-yeah-you-know-me

Notes:

* Overall structure is heading in a good direction - parsing request info
into semantically named keys and values of a hash is useful
* Some leakage of non-parsing responsibilities into the parser object,
so be attentive to that.
* Think especially about names and responsibilities of objects with respect
to the methods they are performing -- do they actually fit
* Testing is good on the things it covers but overall lacking in quantity
* Completion is solid through I3 but didn't get into game application

Scores:

1. Overall Functionality

2: Application implements three iteration

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
