Feature Completeness: 4: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions
Views: 3.5: No logic; check use of partials especially in layout
Controllers: 3.5: Controllers are generally well organized
Models: 3.5: Models show pretty good organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features
Testing: 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels
Usability: 4: Project is highly usable and ready to deploy to customers
Workflow: 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

Jordan, Beth, Greg

Feature Completeness: 4: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions
Views: 3: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through
Controllers: 3: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts
Models: 3: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring
Testing 3.5: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features
Usability: 3: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready
Workflow: 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.
