# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Filtering an Idea](https://github.com/marlomajor/ideaboxTwo/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/filterIdea.js)

[Sorting Ideas by Quality](https://github.com/marlomajor/ideaboxTwo/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/sortIdea.js)
* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I'm proud of the filtering because it's one of the first times I've ever written JS from scratch. After a fantastic pairing session with Lovisa, she reminded me to go back to the fundamentals and so I did and was able to write straight JS! In fact, I was so excited that I sent her this Slack message.

I'm proud of sorting ideas because I got to pair with Steve and learned a clever hack to alternate sorting between ASC -> DESC and DESC -> ASC.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about

[This is gross](https://github.com/marlomajor/ideaboxTwo/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/updateIdea.js)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I couldn't get the update to save upon pressing the enter key, so I had to use this hack where it simulates the enter key being pressed but what actually happens is key 13 triggers an event to click the save button, which does in fact work. As far as refactoring, this piece of code took me through the wringer. There's a lot of duplicated code in this file and everytime I'd refactor, it'd completely break update. This is by far the worst code in my app. Though I'm still super proud it works!

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
