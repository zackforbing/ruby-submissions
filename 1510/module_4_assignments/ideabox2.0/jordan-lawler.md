###Code Quality  
####Pretty Javascript Function: [This javascript allows you to search by Title, Body, or Quality. I really like the way I approached this problem](https://github.com/Jlawlzz/idea_box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/idea_filter.js#L17-L38)  
####Pretty Ruby Logic: [This my model logic for changing quality. I like the breakdown of methods and flow of this particular solution.](https://github.com/Jlawlzz/idea_box/blob/master/app/models/idea.rb)  
####Ugly Javascript: [Had trouble getting inline editing and editing via clicking the edit button to play nice.  Ugly code ensues](https://github.com/Jlawlzz/idea_box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/edit_idea.js#L3-L46)  
####Test Suite:

I ran into some problems with clearing the database while running Selenium tests. Spent more time than I should have troubleshooting. This is something I would like to discuss during code-review!
