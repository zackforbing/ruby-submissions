# Scale Up Submission Form

## Basics

### Summarize the Work you Completed Over the Week
I built and deployed a (very simple) phoenix API.

I tried to build an ember client for it, but did't got any real code.

### Link(s) to Your Work
[Colabora API github](https://github.com/hectorhuertas/colabora_api)

[Live on Heroku](colabora-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/notes)

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
TONS of things, the most amusing are:
* Phoenix deployment is actually pretty easy
* Even if they belong to the same 'big app', API and client have different repositories and different deployments
* The hardest part to hook up both parts of the apps is solving the cross-site security issues
* API formatting is very important to allow for easy client/backend communication. Standarization helps to reduce the helper code needed to make it work.
* Both Phoenix and Ember evolve terribly fast, and it's hard to keep up with the novelties (as a matter of fact, Steve's tutorial on Ember from last week is pretty outdated). The positive thing is that the new features are so useful/cool that it is worthy to keep learning them.

### Link to blog post(s) submitted
* Deploy a Phoenix API on Heroku
* API standarization

Both at [my temporary shitty blog](http://todohectorhuertas.blogspot.com.es/)

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback
It's kind of cool to feel like real developers, but most of the reviews were not very useful (50% of them were 'do you need this commented code?')

Considering the amount of things we need to do this module, I personally don't think it was worth my time.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
Kind of hard for me to say because I wasn't there. I like the idea, but obviously, couldn't experience it.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I am a little sad about how this project ended up. I was very excited about it but in the end I couldn't put much time on it. In Spain I have way too many distractions, and I don't do well micro-tasking (review PR, blog, daily standup, homework, research, coding, jobhunting...)

This last thing is a half-rant: I really don't like mandatory blog posts. I understand their importance and how much good they can do, but, at least for me, they don't work. The amount of time and effort that I need to put to make a post (and a blog) that I am willing to show to the world, is too much. I'm not showing any of my posts to any employers.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (60 points)

Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

  * 60: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
  * 50: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature.
  * 30: Developers attempted to implement extensions using technologies not covered in class but it did not result in a delivered feature.
  * 10: Developers but did not build any features.
