### Provide a screenshot of your application

### Link to any pull requests you submitted outside of your project
- [electron-image-resizer on github](https://github.com/jecrockett/electron-image-resize)
- [electron-image-resizer on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-image-resize)
- Updated an exiting npm module that needed a user to input height and width in order
to resize an image. We added functionality that makes it possible for a user to input one
or the other.

- [dimension-calculator on github](https://github.com/jecrockett/dimension_calculator)
- [dimension-calculator on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dimension_calculator)
- We realized that the calculation we were doing to figure out proportional resizing based on
height or width could extend to any object with those properties. So we submitted our own
npm module to share our knowledge with the world.

### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.
- From Shannon: I honestly didn't know ANYTHING about this stuff until we started the project. The biggest lesson I got out of the prework was going through the firesale tutorial and learning how to split up the functionality and send content to the render process. I still didn't really understand it until we tried to implement Drag and Drop and tried to use a BrowserWindow and call document in the same function...not a good idea.
- From Jamie:

### How far were you able to get on features in your application
- We were able to implement drag and drop, image renaming and resizing multiple images in one process.

### Link to blog post(s) submitted

### Shannon (all parts in one blog post):
  - Title: Image Resizer in Electron
  - Summary: I discuss why we chose this project, why electron was a great fit for what we were doing, why we used React (even though we didn't need to), how we had trouble with Drag and Drop and what features I think would be cool to implement if we had more time.

## Risk Taking
  - After talking to Meeka and hearing that Drag & Drop was "hell" we worried that making it work could be a huge rabbit hole/ risk.
  - We really wanted the D&D functionality, and are glad that we tackled it. After spending a lot of time figuring out how to make it work, we realized that it helped us understand all of our code - and the electron relationships much better.

Instructor Evaluation:

Points: (max 150)

### Rubric

### Blog Post (60 Points - 15 points per section)  

### Participation (30 points)
  * 30: Developer participated daily in courses and stand ups with the group. Developer worked on multiple features or one feature that instructor feels is exceptionally difficult.
  * 20: Developer was absent for 1 lesson, did not participate actively in lessons and peer reviews. Developer worked on one or two 'easier' features.
  * 0: Developer was absent for > 1 lesson, did not participate actively in lessons and peer reviews. Did not deliver or almost deliver any features.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (60 points)

Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

  * 60: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
  * 50: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
  * 30: Developers attempted to implement extensions using technologies not covered in class but it did not result in a delivered feature.
  * 10: Developers but did not build any features.

#### Extension (20 points)

  * Developer contributes to or creates an NPM module/library.
