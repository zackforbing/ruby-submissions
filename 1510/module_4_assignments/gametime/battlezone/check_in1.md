## The Plan

### Approach

- P5 or Canvas?
- Rewrite or Port?
- Testing of points rendering
- Lines rendering + testing
- Horizon rendering
- Cylinder obstacles + collision detection
- Cylinder enemies that don't attack (but move)
- Player can attack + kill ((bz emphasis, not specific) projectile vs click and check if hit (doom emphasis, not specific).  Leaning towards crosshairs + click and check)
- Enemies can attack + kill

    BZ Specific

- Score in dom off canvas (bz ish specific ish)
- Enemies regen (bz specific)
- complex tanks and/or obstacles. (collision circle/box bz specific:: for doom)
- HUD, radar, targetting info.... (bz specific)

    Doom Specific

- Render 2d faces.
- Enemies render differently
- Health
- Build a level...
- Limited Ammo
- Health pickups + Ammo pickups
- HUD w/ bloody face
- Multiple weapons, body armor, ...

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- Player moves around the screen in 1st person 3D.
- Obstacles are randomly generated on game load which prevent the player's movement.
- Enemy tanks are randomly generated which can move around and fire at the player.
- Player can fire weapon and destroy enemy tanks.
- Player has access to radar, range information, score and high score.
- On screen targeter indicating when enemy targeted.
- Background rendered
- New game screen, end game screen, score tracking in cookie.  

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

As above but without...

- Obstacles
- Radar + range + targeting information.
- Background.
- tank-like rendering of enemies.

### What have you accomplished so far?

Solid DTR and how this is going to be implemented, especially concerning rendering.
