Notes:
* test suite -  48 tests, 57 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 97%
* test harness - 1 error, 1 failure
* uses #each a lot where there are better choices for enumerables
* generally good separation of responsibilities, but some refactoring could still be used
* some repetition, but 3am sucks


### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills expectations of Iterations 0 - 4 *as well as* one of Iterations 5 or 6

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring


### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods


### 6. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

* 4: Zero complaints
