Notes:
* Spec harness passes through iteration 2
* Some test coverage, but inconsistent
* Need to extract from large methods and test

### 1. Functional Expectations
* 1: Application crashes during normal usage

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### 6. Code Sanitation
* 1: More than ten complaints
