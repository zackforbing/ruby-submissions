* Not full functionality
* Could use more time breaking functionality into smaller methods

## Scores:

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring


### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
