Jeff Gu
-------

1. Satisfactory Progress

Score: 3

2. Ruby Syntax & Style

Score: 3

* When stuff gets complex (eg those params), figure out why, and also whether there is a way to cleanly handle it

3. Rails Style & API

Score: 3

* The Enum has more to offer, key insight is that you get to deal with names, not numbers

4. Testing

Score: 3

* Pay attention to naming (clarify your thoughts with the names)
* With the feature ones, a more holistic usage of the behaviour wouldn't be difficult to add, but would increase your confidence considerably

Score: 3

* Completes base challenges
* Looks pretty nice / pleasant to use :)
* Board#title should be required

3. Rails Style & API

Score: 4

4. Testing

Kyra Steenbock
--------------

1. Satisfactory Progress

Score: 3

* Tickets progress, but not regress

2. Ruby Syntax & Style

Score: 4

3. Rails Style & API

Score: 3

* The key insight of the enum is that you don't ever have to use the integer database representation (you know... minus that next_status thing we made >.<)

4. Testing

Score: 3

* Use `create!` to immediately fail the test if it doesn't save (errors that tell you where the real problem is)
* Guard against other ways that the test could unintentionally pass
