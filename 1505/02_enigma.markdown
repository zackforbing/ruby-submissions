### Sebastian Abondano

* Project GitHub URL:
* Instructor Notes:

## 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

## 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.
* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

## 3. Overall Functionality

( Pending edits )

* 4: Application warns the user when the output file exists and allows them to cancel the operation or overwrite the file
* 3: Application reads and writes files as described
* 2: Application can only specify either the input or output file name
* 1: Application uses only static filenames

## 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together
