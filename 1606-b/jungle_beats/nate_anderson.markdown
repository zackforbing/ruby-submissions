Notes:
- Completed 2 extensions
- Built with TDD, thorough suite of tests
- Opp to improve with test names
- Nice extraction of methods in some cases, would like to see that process applied consistently across code
- Some refactoring needed, minor opportunities to make code more readable
- Watch using data structure labels in variable names
- Nice use of loops, would like to see experimentation with recursion


## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations
* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion
* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
