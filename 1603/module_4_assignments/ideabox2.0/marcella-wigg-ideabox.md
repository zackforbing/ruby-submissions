[Link to Code](https://github.com/marcellawigg/bright-ones/blob/master/test/requests/api/v1/ideas_controller_test.rb)
* Sounds dumb, but I am really proud to be testing my controllers more thoroughly.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

[Link To Code](https://github.com/AnnaCW/ideabox/blob/d4bd9aa93ac951c9d06a85dffc4a425a242d07c8/app/assets/javascripts/edit_ideas.js#L1-L47)

* This is a link to part of my code for the edit ideas (title and body) functionality. I had a lot of challenges in trying to get this to work, so I'm proud of it in the sense that I got it working. I don't feel great about it in that I'm sure this is not the best way to do it, and the code just looks messy. I was not able to test it so I am hesitant to refactor.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
