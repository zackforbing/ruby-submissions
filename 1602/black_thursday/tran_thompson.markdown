Notes:

- Talked breifly about some strategies to break up a long method
- Better encapsulation. Sales engine doesn't need to be everywhere
- Split your data and your tests as much as you can
- Have faster tests so you can run the whole suite all the time
- There are better enumerable options (`.select` instead of `.map` + `.compact` for instance)
- Good naming
- Good waffling
- Good test coverage

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, (4 or 5), and features of your own design
* **3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5**
* 2: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, and 3
* 1: Application does not fully implement iterations 0, 1, 2, and 3

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
* **3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality**
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
* **3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP**
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* **3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring**
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
* **3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods**
* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques
* 1: Application demonstrates deficiencies with Enumerable and struggles with collections

### 6. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

* **4: Zero complaints**
* 3: Five or fewer complaints
* 2: Six to ten complaints
* 1: More than ten complaints
