## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 4: Application implements all five iterations and at least one extension
* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4
* 2: Application implements iterations 0 - 3
* 1: Application implements through interation 2 or less

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.
* 2: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together
