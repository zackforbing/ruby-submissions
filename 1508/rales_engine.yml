    instructor: Andrew
    notes: Reached for ruby within a handful of quieries. No model level tests, but controller tests had moderate to good robustness. Some stretegy changes were suggested within testing. Some refactoring of queries would have been good.

    notes: Good project. Queries fall to ruby sometimes but does use advanced active record too. TDD was good at the controller level but not at model level. Only two model level.

    notes: Code quality could be focused on more. The controllers had some issues. Testing was good overall but could have used some model tests.

    repo: github.com/emilydowdle/rails-engine
    instructor: Andrew
    notes: Great quieries but did reach for some ruby. Good code quality. Overall a good project. The tests were really good. To be perfect there would be more tests for find and findall etc, but there were good unit and controller tests.

  Jason Pilz:
    repo:
    instructor: Josh M.
    notes: Solid project. Some queries there was a little confusion about but the queries themselves were solid. Hashes used to format instead of serializers.
    completion: 3: Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.
    test-driven-development: 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

    api-design: 3: Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.
    queries: 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

    instructor: Andrew
    notes: Most important thing to work on moving forward is refactoring. Code uality was ok, but could have reworked some queries. Only one piece of logic in controller, but it was the last thing being worked. No model level tests and some gaps controller test robustness.

    instructor: Andrew
    notes: Solid project. Good robust controller tests, but no model tests. Could have done some more for testing. Quieries were good and had mostly activerecord, but did reach for ruby. At times I think the ruby was unessesary and could have been accomplished fairly easily with AR.

  Ryan Johnson:
