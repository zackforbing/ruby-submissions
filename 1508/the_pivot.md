Production Link: ganesha-loans.herokuapp.com  

Notes: Good project delivered. Very painful load times, but no crashes. Used waffle as project management tool. Kept user experience as a 3 even though it was painful to user because the UI was well constructed. Delivery was as expected but nothing above and beyond.

Notes: UI was really intuitive and looked good, but the seed file was not implimented to the extent required so it could have been painful if it was. Some items didn't link to muti-tenant url structure. Adding store appeared to be successful, but didn't work on the side of the user made as an admin

Notes:

Good UI experience, but had issue with crashes on small parts of app. Also when you inactivated a renter's profile you could still go to their property page.

Production Link: stalk-photos.herokuapp.com

Notes: Not seeded with appropriate amounts of data. UI was otherwise generally good. There were issues with images overlapping buttons and other content which was apparently due to the person styling on a computer set up with different display preferences. App crashed when trying to load image from category page. Could not update user profile photo either.

Production Link: ticketly.herokuapp.com

Notes:

  Good UI. Some really great additional features. App failed to update ticket status. Also a minor error in Platform Admin functionality.


  * Some gaps in testing. Some code is executing but not providing or testing the actual business value.
  * Most are solid and when adjusting during the to make them more robust they still passed.
  * Took good risks and went above and beyond expectations without the code quality suffering.
