# Game Time Check In # 3

## Instructor Goal Completion

### GOAL 1: Adding a net with collision detection

Nope.

#### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

### GOAL 2: Add scoring

[https://github.com/patwey/slime-volleyball/blob/master/lib/scripts/scoreboard.js](https://github.com/patwey/slime-volleyball/blob/master/lib/scripts/scoreboard.js)

#### Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.

Nope.

#### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

The spec says we should display the score at the end of the game, but we don't think this is the best option for us. Is it okay just to display who wins? (This is what the original game does).

## Next Steps?
