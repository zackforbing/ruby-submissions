## Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[https://github.com/patwey/slime-volleyball/blob/master/lib/scripts/ball.js](https://github.com/patwey/slime-volleyball/blob/master/lib/scripts/ball.js)
- We're proud of this code because it breaks out a lot of logic (lots of small functions) and it makes complicated logic more readable as a result.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[https://github.com/patwey/slime-volleyball/blob/master/lib/scripts/game.js](https://github.com/patwey/slime-volleyball/blob/master/lib/scripts/game.js)
- We feel not awesome about this code because logic is not as broken out as we'd like, making it a bit confusing to follow the flow of the game. Challenges we faced trying to refactor it was the importance of order to the game.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

Eval: 118

Total: 268

Functional Expectations

20 points - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

User Interface

15 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

Testing

25 points - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

JavaScript Style

20 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow

25 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Code Sanitation
The output from JSHint shows…
