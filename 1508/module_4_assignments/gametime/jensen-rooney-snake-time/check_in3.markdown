## Instructor Goal Completion

### GOAL 1

Get Test Coverage Up

#### Provide a screenshot or gif or link to code for this goal

![Unit Tests](images/snake-test-cov.png)

#### Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.

After consulting Meeka, we do feel that the Unit Testing is valuable. WE do not feel that pursuing "Feature" tests is plausible or valuable. 

Meeka responded to an inquiry regarding if a feature test is expected during this check-in:
"Hey Adam - the expectation is to test as much as possible/reasonable. Not sure if you can specifically capybara style test clicking around on canvas"

#### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

Topics to discuss: 
* Drawing
* Spying
* undefined canvas

### GOAL 2

Fix the unintended side effect of the Snake being able to travel over itself.
deliverable: there is sort of a grid system implemented by restricting the snake and the food to take on coordinates as multiples of 10.

## Next Steps?

### What do you feel you HAVE to complete before the Evals?

* Portal Bug 
* Give Toggle functionality to all buttons/modes

### What features would be nice to haves before the Evals?

We feel that Snake-Time is pretty "feature-heavy" and we feel that out focus should be spent on points above.

### General Questions, Comments, Concerns?

* `setInveral`. Is there a better way to handle various speeds?
