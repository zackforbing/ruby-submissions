## Completion

### Do You Consider the Application to be Fully Playable?

Yes. The base level game is playable. I feel that the extra modes are un-needed and make the game a little less-playable. They were implemented as challenges from instructors. 

### What Extensions, as Requested By an Instructor, Did You Complete?
Per Extension:
- Vim Mode 
- [vim](https://github.com/adamki/snake/blob/master/lib/index.js#L156-L185)

- Speed Mode 
- [Speed](https://github.com/adamki/snake/blob/master/lib/index.js#L43-L64)

- Walls Mode
- [walls mode](https://github.com/adamki/snake/blob/master/lib/index.js#L100-L106)

- Portals Mode
- [portals](https://github.com/adamki/snake/blob/master/lib/portal.js)


### What Features, if Any, Do You Feel Exceed Instructor Expectations?

Not only did we have build out the mentioned features aboe, we also set them on a timer and implmented a POWER - UP bonus round that lasts 5 seconds.This made Vim, Speed, Walls and Portals mode use-able and made the game much more fun.

## Risk Taking
- What risks did you feel you took on this project?
We invested alot of our time into feature-rich snake game. 

- How do you feel about those risks?
On one hand, we are proud that the game is Both playable and that it does MORE than every other Snake Game.
However, we noticed that other areas of our code did suffer. We built fast and I think we lost some code quality. We also overlooked the importance of testing at times.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Matt and I felt like the overall experience was great and are happy with the results of this game/project. We would have liked a bit more time re-factoring. To elaborate, The lessons taught every morning were always pretty impressive and we were eager to apply those principles to our game. However, we felt that we were always trying to implement a new feature instead of having time to re-factor.
