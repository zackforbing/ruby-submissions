## Risk Taking
- What risks did you feel you took on this project?
- The game was really difficult. We felt that we wanted to push ourselves so that we could understand JavaScript and it's object orient model more clearly. We also wanted to stretch our testing abilities and we felt that this game would allow us to do that. It did, but the logic behind the game was really difficult. With 3 models, 7 pieces, 4 rotations, and having all of these things interact with each other was really difficult.

- How do you feel about those risks?
- We don't regret them. With as much as we know about JavaScript the only thing missing in our application is the ability to clear a row. If given another day we would of totally gotten it. We've learned so much about this language and I feel that this risk will pay off in the future. We are proud of our understanding of higher-level functions (partials), object oriented design in j.s., and ability to iterate through objects.
