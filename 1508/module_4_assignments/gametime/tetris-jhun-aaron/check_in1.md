## The Plan

### Goals for the finished product

- Pieces fall from top of screen
- User can rotate each piece before it hits the floor
- When a piece hits the floor, it is locked into position
- If the pieces complete a "row", the user wins points and the pieces drop off screen
- If the pieces stack to the "ceiling", the game ends
- Pieces are various colors, constant for each shape
- User can stop/start the game by clicking a "pause"/"resume" button
- Increase difficulty with speed as the user advances
- Extension: multi-level difficulty based on speed, choice at beginning of play

### MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan

- Pieces fall from top of screen
- User rotates pieces until they are locked in
- If the pieces stack to the ceiling, the game ends

### Accomplished so far

- Researched game logic for pseudo code
- Wrote initial user stories on Waffle
- Starting to build the pieces necessary for game play

### Questions, Comments, Concerns

- Are we approaching it correctly?
- How much should we have accomplished by the next checkin?
