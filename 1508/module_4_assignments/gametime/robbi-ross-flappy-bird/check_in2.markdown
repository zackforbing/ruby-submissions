# Game Time Check In # 2

## Instructor Goal Completion

### GOAL 1
* Smooth out FrameRate speeds, specifically smoothing out the Jorge jump.

#### Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.
* We implemented a momentum counter. Click or spacebar events add to the counter. The move method checks for momentum and either moves up or down.

#### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

### GOAL 2
* Collision or Score - not the visual implementation, having the backend mechanics recognize the pipes passing.

#### Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.

* Score is increased when the bird's (jorge) x coordinate passes through the middle of the pipes x coordinate. We may be able to improve the implementation using EventEmitter?


* Collision Detection was implemented by defining the coordinates of the bird's 4 corners and also defining the 'safe zone' coordinates between the pipes. As soon as the bird crosses the x coordinate of a pipe, we begin checking if bird is in 'safe zone'.

#### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

* Currently if a 'collisonEvent' is detected we are jumping from the main gameLoop, to a endGameLoop. Maybe a better way to do this?

### GOAL 3
* Background Image - including thinking about parallax scrolling.

  * See above screenshots

#### Did you deviate from the instructions? Tell us about it.

* We are pretty happy with the images we got so far, eventually we will swap out the Jorge image with the traditional flappy-bird and plan on making a 'Jorge mode'.

#### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

* O_o

## Next Steps?

### What do you feel the next steps should be?

* Add a start/intro screen with start button.
* Store High Score in localStorage
* Refine the physics of bird to make more on par with the real flappy-bird.
* Refactor game.js
