## Completion

### Were you able to complete what you feel is the base functionality?  
Yes.

### What features did you complete which you feel 'exceeded expectations'?
- Datepicker + Timepicker where you can select one, or both, or neither for setting a poll's expiration.

### Attach a .gif, or images of any extensions work being used on the site.

# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of  
[poll.js](https://github.com/matt-stj/crowdsourcer/blob/master/lib/poll.js#L5-L43)
#### Why were you proud of this piece of code?  
Because the way that I structured the poll constructor and the expiration times    really helped to make my project easier as I got further along into websockets and more difficult logic.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Expiration](https://github.com/matt-stj/crowdsourcer/blob/master/server.js#L75-L88)
#### Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?  
I'm proud of the fact that I got this section done, however, I wasn't able to get the expiration time to register unless it was nested within this block of code.  Seemed like it should've worked anywhere, but for some odd reason, I couldn't pull it out and maintain working functionality.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
