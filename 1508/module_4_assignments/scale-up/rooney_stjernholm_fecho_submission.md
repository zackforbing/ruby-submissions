[Getters and Setters for File-Bin](https://github.com/stevekinney/file-bin/pull/12)
- Build getters and setters for fethching and reassigning File-Bin's base directory property.  

### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.  
- We knew nothing about Ember or Electron.  The pre-work assignments showed how easy it can be to get a desktop app off the ground.

### How far were you able to get on features in your application
- All Base functionality complete.  Added a couple small bells and whistles, but mostly tussled with an extension of trying to use implement our getter and setter functions from File-Bin to change our base directory.

### Part 1:
  - Title: Lessons Learned From Building an Electron Desktop App (Ember.js +File-Bin)
  - Summary: Electron is awesome.  Ember is hard. Contributing to File-Bin was neat.

## Risk Taking
  - What risks did you feel you took on this project?
  - Tried to add functionality that wasn't required and failed at implementing it, but learned a ton while banging our heads against the keyboard.  Working with Electron's main process became much more clear, and we picked up quite a bit about how Ember Data is passed around.

  - How do you feel about those risks?
  - Frustrated that we didn't get it to work, but happy that we tried it.  Seemed to be a great exercise to try implementing our File-Bin conribution within our project.  Really helped tie together the process of contributing to an open-source library.
