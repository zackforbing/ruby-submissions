#### Notes

Pain: Fixutre data

* Difficult to create fixture data for all these tests
* Difficult to veirfy it

We can deal with this by making a sales engine that
knows nothing about the source of the data,
it just expects hashes of attributes

```ruby
class SimpleSalesEngine < SalesEngine
  def initialize(data)
    @data = data
  end

  def startup
    merchants = @data.fetch(merchants, []).map do |merchant|
      [merchant[:id], merchant[1]] # ...
    end
    items = @data.fetch(items, []).map do |item|
      [item[:id], item[:name], item[:description], item[:unit_price]] # ...
    end
    @merchant_repository = MerchantRepository.new(self, merchants)
    @item_repository     = ItemRepository.new(self, items)
  end
end
```

Then in our test:

```ruby
class MerchantTest < Minitest::Test
  def sales_engine_with(custom_data)
    sse = SimpleSalesEngine.new(custom_data)
    sse.startup
    sse
  end

  def test_items__it_returns_an_array_of_its_items
    se = sales_engine_with(
      merchants: [{id: 1}, {id: 2}],
      items:     [
        {id: 1, merchant_id: 1},
        {id: 2, merchant_id: 2},
        {id: 3, merchant_id: 1},
        {id: 4, merchant_id: 2},
      ]
    )

    se.mechant_repository.find_by(:id, 1)
    se.mechant_repository.find_by(:id, 1)
  end
end
```

If you wanted to test mass data, you could do:

```ruby
se = sales_engine_with(
  merchants: 100_000.times.map { |i| {id: i} },
  items:     100_000.times.flat_map { |id|
    10.times.map { |offset|
      {id: (id*offset)+offset, merchant: id}
    }
  ]
)
```


The issue with class variables: they shift across classes.

```ruby
class Parent
  @@a = 1
  def self.a
    @@a
  end

  @b = 1
  def self.b
    @b
  end
end

class Child < Parent
  @@a = 2
  @b = 2
end

class Child2 < Parent
  @@a = 3
  @b = 3
end

Child2.a # => 3
Child.a  # => 3
Parent.a # => 3

Child2.b # => 3
Child.b  # => 2
Parent.b # => 1
```

4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD


##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* Score: 3
* The repo doesn't need to know where the data comes from.
  By knowing, it cannot handle input from other sources.
* Inheriting useful methods from Repository

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* Score: 3
* Watch whitespace

4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
1: Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

##### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* Score: 3.5
* Enjoyed the lookup tables
* Some ability to use other enumerable methods `#each`

4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques
1: Application demonstrates deficiencies with Enumerable and struggles with collections

##### 6. Code Sanitation

The output from rake sanitation:all shows…

4: Zero complaints

#### Notes

Using tests for design:

```
1. Identify that you are experiencing pain
  * My tests take forever
  * I have to cross references CSVs
  * I break tests when I add data for this test
2. Identify the cause of that pain
  * I can't operate on the repo without dealing with the CSV and file system and paths and so forth
3. Push the painful thing up the callstack
  * How did I get heree?
  * What code invoked my piece of code?
  * The painful thing still has to be dealt with, so I'll give it to them.



Some nice things that fall out of pushing difficulties up the stack:


```ruby
# find me the jim with the most items
mr = MerchantRepository.new([
  Merchant.new(id: 1, name: "Jim"),
  Merchant.new(id: 2, name: "Cara"),
  Merchant.new(id: 3, name: "Jim"),
  Merchant.new(id: 4, name: "Sally"),
])

best_jim = mr.find_all_by_name("Jim")
             .most_items(1)


# Maybe I want a test like find_by_id
mr = MerchantRepository.new([
  Merchant.new(id: 1, name: 'a'),
  Merchant.new(id: 2, name: 'b'),
])

assert_equal 'a', mr.find_by_id(1).name
assert_equal 'b', mr.find_by_id(2).name
assert_equal nil, mr.find_by_id(3).name


# I could even get the data from the web, if I wanted!
```
