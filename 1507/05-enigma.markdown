### Alon Waisman

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/MowAlon/Enigma.git

#### Notes

* Not as problematic as BST. Assignment had a more detailed description.
* 34 tests with 2 skips
* Tests document the core functionality
* Implementation is well broken down and easy to follow
* Let's talk about constants one day ... but the idea is great
* Crack is very good

#### Scores

* Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 4

### Matt Ewell

* GitHub URL:

#### Notes

* Didn't plan well enough, was making it too complicated
* 95 tests, about 13 broken
* Implementation has lots of neat pieces, but the stitching together is
somewhat rough -- maybe trying to do things too right the first time
* Like the direction of the testing. Make sure to run all tests from root
and run them all together frequently
* Make sure to run command-line scripts and tests from project root

#### Scores

* Functionality: 2
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3

## With Josh Cheek

### Chad Minnerath and Michael Wong

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/Kealii/Enigma

#### Notes

#### Scores

* Functionality:
  * Score: 3
  * Encrypts / decrypts / cracks
* Fundamental Ruby & Style:
  * Score: 3
  * Don't do the work in initialize
* Test-Driven Development:
  * Score: 3
  * Can't run all tests
  * Have to edit the code to run tests
  * Tests have good names
* Breaking Logic into Components:
  * Score: 2
  * Move difficult bits up the stack (ARGV, file reading / writing, printing)

### Jeff Ruane and Jerrod Paul Junker

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/Unsafepond/Enigma-new

#### Notes

#### Scores

* Functionality:
  * Score: 2
  * No cracking
* Fundamental Ruby & Style:
  * Score: 3+
  * Like the "function objects" ie decryptor
  * The binary was nice
* Test-Driven Development:
  * Score: 3
  * When something is difficult to test, identify what is making it difficult and push that higher in the callstack
    (ie stdin/stdout are provided by the test / binary, and then we can give it a version that records what was printed
    and provides the input that the tests want to give it)
* Breaking Logic into Components:
  * Score: 3+

### Chris Cenatiempo and Justin Pease

* GitHub URL:

#### Notes

#### Scores

* Functionality:
  * Score: 4
  * Does all the things (might be nice to get error messages on missing inputs)
* Fundamental Ruby & Style:
  * Score: 3
  * A few indentation issues
* Test-Driven Development:
  * Score: 4
  * Nice using mrspec!
* Breaking Logic into Components:
  * Score: 3
  * Pretty good abstractions
  * You probably don't need that many classes ;)

### Mimi Schatz and Regis Boudinot

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/selfup/enigma

#### Notes

#### Scores

* Functionality:
  * Score: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style:
  * Score: 3
* Test-Driven Development:
  * Score: 3-
* Breaking Logic into Components:
  * Score: 2
  * Use the interface before it exists, so that you can discover what it should be.
    This will lead to elegance.
  * Prefer interfaces where there is no way for the object to be used wrong
    (ie don't let other objects coordinate the methods of this object)
  * If the object is a verb (crack, encrypt, decrypt -- vs key, date, etc),
    choose interfaces like "here are your inputs, give me the output",
    this omits "state" (instance variables) and thus will lead to the above suggestions.
    eg `Crack.new(encrypted_message).crack` ...or, given the "functions" style we talked about
    during modules yesterday: `Crack.call(encrypted_message)`


### Nicole Hall and Adam Jensen

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/NicoleHall/Enigma-Project

#### Notes

#### Scores

* Functionality:
  * Score 3
  * Does encrypting, decrypting, cracking in under 1 second
  * Does not print the correct key
* Fundamental Ruby & Style:
  * Score 3
  * Watch whitespace
* Test-Driven Development:
  * Score 2
  * Tests don't pass
* Breaking Logic into Components:
  * Score 3
  * When testing is difficult
    1. Identify that it is painful
    2. What is making it difficult, eg our notes:

       ```
       The painful things
         reading / writing / printing / global vars (ARGV)
       The solution
         Push the painful things up the callstack
         (the method that called it has to deal with it)
       ```
    3. Remove the painful thing by pushing it up the callstack.
       Thus, the calling environment has to deal with it.
