Project Description: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rales_engine.markdown

### Completion

* 4 - Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness and one or more extensions
* 3 - Project completes all requirements according to the spec harness
* 2 - Project completes most requirements but fails 4 or fewer spec harness tests
* 1 - Project fails more than 4 spec harness tests

### Rails and ActiveRecord Style

* 4 - Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` or `includes`
* 3 - Project makes good use of ActiveRecord to fulfill Business Reqs, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods
* 2 - Project has some gaps in AR usage, including numerous business methods that rely on ruby enumerables to find the appropriate data
* 1 - Project struggles to establish a coherent AR schema, including missing relationships or dysfunctional queries

### Ruby Style and Code Quality

* 4 - Project demonstrates excellent Ruby style. Logic is pushed down the stack and various POROs or Serializers are used to assist with complicated logic
* 3 - Project uses idiomatic Ruby with a handful of larger methods or bloated controllers
* 2 - Project struggles to design useful Objects or push logic down the stack
* 1 - Project struggles with basic ruby method and class design

### API Design

* 4 - Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, Serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling
* 3 - Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features
* 2 - Project has inconsistencies or gaps in how its JSON data is organized or formatted
* 1 - Project's API is not fully functional or has significant confusion around request formats

### Test Driven Design

* 4 - Project has exceptional test coverage at various application levels, including coverage for edge cases and complicated logic methods
* 3 - Project has solid test coverage at multiple levels of the application, but skips some edge cases or complicated methods
* 2 - Project focuses tests on only a single layer of the stack, or has large gaps in the coverage
* 1 - Project has test failures, significant gaps in coverage, or a general paucity of tests
