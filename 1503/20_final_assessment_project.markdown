### Brett

__Student:__ Brett

__Instructor:__ Horace

__Repo:__ https://github.com/brettgrigsby/goober

__Production URL:__ https://cryptic-wildwood-2673.herokuapp.com/

__Notes:__

* Nice use of PORO's to manage unconventional activerecord relationships
* Testing looks good; great coverage on integration tests; keep
pushing more testing weight into model tests
* JS refresher makes good use of server-rendered partials to handle
UI updating
* Minor bits of model code floating into controllers
* Basic cases are real smooth; don't forget to watch for edge cases
around state machine and role-management
* Consistent use of partials to simplify UI handling

__Production URL:__ http://guber.herokuapp.com/

__Notes:__

* Interesting take on rider / driver division and modeling
* Awesome testing; exceptionally thorough on feature/integration tests
* Still some room for more granular model tests and larger, less
  granular integration tests
* Nice use of PORO for ride duration / distance estimation

### Drew

__Student:__ Drew Reynolds

__Instructor:__ Horace

__Repo:__ https://github.com/NYDrewReynolds/goober

__Production URL:__ http://goober-app.herokuapp.com/

__Notes:__

* nice use of helper methods to keep view code clean
* keep pushing logic down from helpers into models (helpers are great
but should mostly be an interface into model logic)
* effective management of dual-role system on top of single
users table -- keep in mind you can structure your routes and
controllers more liberally even if it's just 1 table
* (i.e. have separate rider / driver routes and controllers even
if they share a table)
* Tests look good; good use of integration tests for high-level
  coverage; keep looking for logic to push into model layer and at
  the same time include in unit tests
* Map code ends up real simple and easy

### Sally

__Student:__ Sally MacNicholas

__Instructor:__ Horace

__Repo:__ https://github.com/sallymacnicholas/goober

__Production URL:__ http://goober.herokuapp.com/

__Notes:__

* Great RESTful routing  -- separating driver / rider paths on top
of single table
* good use of controller filters and helpers to structure the
auth and request logic
* Testing is solid at integration and model level; keep making sure
that we're really covering the core logic in our model tests
* Like use of RideDetails class to handle mapping / eta

### Justin

__Student:__ Justin

__Instructor:__ Horace

__Repo:__ https://github.com/Justin-Holmes/goober

__Production URL:__ https://whispering-retreat-3568.herokuapp.com/

__Notes:__

* 2 tables r cool -- handled routing and creation of these well
* good use of small helper ruby objects for managing pricing and status
  updating
* ^ in combo with good unit testing on these components
* admin stuff works well and is cool; having existing PORO things for
updating and calculating price gives us a good place to hook this
logic in
