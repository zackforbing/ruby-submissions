## Completion

### Were you able to complete the base functionality?
* I was able to complete functionality for adding ideas, deleting ideas, and modifying the quality for ideas. I was not able to fully complete the search filters and the editing function for title and body of an idea, but each of these features is partially complete.

### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?
* I did not complete extensions

### Attach a .gif, or images of any extensions work being used on the site.

# Code Quality

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Code Link](https://github.com/concach/idea_box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ideas.js#L48-L60)
* I am proud of this particular piece of code because I think it wisely uses function arguments to update a function, and it is designed to be re-usable across updates to multiple attributes of an idea.

### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Code Link](https://github.com/concach/idea_box/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ideas.js#L131-L156)
* I do not feel particularly great about this piece of code because I know that my event listeners are flawed, and my search bar code (commented out) does not function properly.

### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
