### Summarize what you worked on the last two weeks

  I worked on learning React, implementing a service object, refactoring, and building out the Favorite Jobs functionality.

### Hours logged this week?

- Monday (0 hours): 0 hours

### Talk about something from the pre-work that you didn't know about before this week.

  I'm not sure there was anything that I learned from the pre-work this week, but I definitely got more practice with bind and call, which were pretty hazy concepts before now.

### Link to blog post(s) submitted

  [Blog Post: How to Get Started in a Brownfield Project](https://medium.com/@zackforbing/where-to-begin-with-lookingfor-202803ecf1b0#.rn239k45d)

### Discuss: your experience doing PR reviews and getting PR feedback

  I responded to several PRs on different projects:
  [LookingFor](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd/pull/91)
  [ClimbingSensei](https://github.com/roscalabrin/climbing-sensei/pull/33)
  [TextTalk](https://github.com/ryanflach/text_talk/pull/1)

  getting feedback was really good, when I got it, but I felt like I struggled to receive a lot of meaningful feedback on some of my PRs.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

  standups were good for me. It was a great time to refocus and make sure I was doing what I needed to be doing instead of getting off track. It also made me feel more like a part of a team instead of six people all doing different things.

### What features would you like to see the open source project you worked on have in the future?

  I'd definitely like to see someone finish my implementation of the Favorites view, so you can see JUST the jobs you have added to your favorites. I think this functionality is a great addition to LookingFor.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

  since there's no place to put our blog post reviews, I'll post them here:

  blog review: matt packer

  hey Matt, I've got some feedback on your blog post.

  I really like all the links you've peppered in. you've made it really easy for people to find out more about the various projects and concepts you touch on without making your blog post a novel. I also liked that you laid out your MVP with your reasoning for why that much work was necessary. I'm glad that you touched on the real-world factor of time running out, it definitely bears noting that this is a time-limited project. I only really have one concern - it ends rather abruptly. I think a paragraph of takeaways or just a conclusion would help wrap it up a little more gracefully, although it definitely looks like you've hit the requirement for blog length on this one.

  hope that helps!

  blog review: kris sparks

  great blog post, man! couple of things:
  you mention React being maintained by facebook twice. I think you should keep the second one, as it fits the format of your comparison paragraph about Angular.
  the parens aside about typescript seems a little bit of a wonky sentence. maybe try to integrate that into the sentence instead of parenthesizing it?
  I only really have grammar fixes, because the info presented here seems rock solid. good work!
