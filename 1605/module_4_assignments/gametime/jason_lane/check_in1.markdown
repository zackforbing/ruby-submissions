### Game Name

Something cool (will be defined by progress)

### Give a Basic Description of the Game

The player block will move with the movement of the curser and continue moving until success or failure of the game. The enemy blocks with move from the top left to the bottom right of the screen and wrap back around to continue moving. The enemy blocks will have varying speed and size. The goal of the game is to move the player block in order to avoid collision with the enemy blocks. The score will be calculated by adding 20 points for every second that the player is still playing. Three collision events with enemy blocks or one collision event with the boarders of the canvas will result in a came over.
