## Next Steps?

- Calculating & storing the total game score (individual level scoring already implemented)
- Adding a `Start Game` button that renders the canvas & begins game loop
- Refactoring `index.js`---pulling out Levels logic into a Levels constructor
- Increase test coverage
- Allowing the player to retry a failed level (rather than starting over from level 1)
