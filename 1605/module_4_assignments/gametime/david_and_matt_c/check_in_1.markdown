## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

e.g.

- Slimes cannot move past the nets or the walls
- Slimes can hit the ball and the ball will fly with believable trajectory
- If the ball hits the ground, the other slime scores a point
- The first to seven points wins
- Two players can play on the same computer
- A player could play against AI

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

- Slimes can hit the ball and the ball will fly with believable trajectory
- If the ball hits the ground, the other slime scores a point
