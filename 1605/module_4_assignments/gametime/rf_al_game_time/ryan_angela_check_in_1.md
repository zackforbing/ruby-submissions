## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- Jeepney travels on a straight line along a 2d road
- The jeepney's movement is actually static - movement is signified by buildings passing in the background
- Jeepney can jump to avoid obstacles in the street
- When the jeepney successfully avoids an obstacle the player earns points
- When the jeepney collides with an obstacle the obstacle is removed from the canvas and the jeepney loses health
- Bonus items appear that are worth health (or points if at full health)
- Difficulty is automatically increased as the user plays by increasing speed and frequency of obstacles
- [Extension] The jeepney is able to pick up and drop off passengers to gain additional points

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

- Jeepney travels on a straight line along a 2d road
- The jeepney's movement is actually static - movement is signified by buildings passing in the background
- Jeepney can jump to avoid obstacles in the street
- When the jeepney successfully avoids an obstacle the player earns points
- When the jeepney collides with an obstacle the obstacle is removed from the canvas and the jeepney loses health

### What have you accomplished so far?

- HTML/CSS template has been created
- Canvas has been added to the screen
- Initial classes have been created and tested
- Ability to draw a sprite to the canvas

### Questions, Comments, Concerns?

- We understand that certain elements may be more difficult to achieve than we initially anticipate. We would rather create an MVP that is a satisfying experience for the user than a feature-heavy game that is not enjoyable.
