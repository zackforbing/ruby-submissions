Notes:
* Really great job
* Code is written well, but definitely can be refactored so that models and
 controllers are dealing with single responsibility
* Playlist could be refactored out so that it is only modeling data on the
 playlist, and have a playlist generator that would be generating all of the
 data to make a playlist
* Testing needs work. Service is not tested at all
* Opportunity for helpers in the view so you aren't chaining a lot of methods
