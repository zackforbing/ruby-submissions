Notes:

* first iterations built with TDD
* TDD for round class got a little sketch
* for runner class, hardcoded questions and answers, did not use iteration or dynamic values
* classes built for first iterations were not used in runner file

Scores:


### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient given projet requirements.

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear.

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* not graded (did not implement enumerables for iterations 5, 6)

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques
* 1: Application demonstrates deficiencies with Enumerable and struggles with collections
