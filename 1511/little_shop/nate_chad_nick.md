Evaluator: Andrew

Notes:

* Logic in views, only a couple times but needs to be refactored
* Views also had a fair amount of conditionals
* Refactoring the DB design would have been very helpful



## Evaluation Process

For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the
following criteria:

### 1. Feature Completeness

* 3: All features defined in the assignment are correctly implemented

### 2. Views

* 3: Views make use of layout(s), partials and helpers, but some logic leaks through

### 3. Controllers

* 3: Controllers are generally well organized with three or fewer particularly ugly parts

### 4. Models

* 3: Models show an effort to push logic down the stack, but need more internal refactoring

### 5. Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features

### 6. Usability

* 3: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready

### 7. Workflow

* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.
