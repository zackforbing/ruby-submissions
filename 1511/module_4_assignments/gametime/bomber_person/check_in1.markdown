## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

e.g.

* 4 player using web sockets
* Power-ups
* Ability to "kick" bombs
* Can drop bombs. Bombs will ignite other bombs
* Block are destroyed when a bomb hits it
* Bomber Person is destroyed when hit by a bomb
* Last 30 seconds the map begins to shrink
* Scoreboard (best of 5?)
* When you die, you have the ability to throw bombs. If you kill a Bomber Person
while throwing a bomb you then switch with them.
* Game settings
* Some sort of invitation system? Rooms?
* Chat
* Different levels
* Different skins (bomber person, bombs, etc...)

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

e.g.

* Local two player
* Can drop bombs. Bombs will ignite other bombs
* Block are destroyed when a bomb hits it
* Bomber Person is destroyed when hit by a bomb
* Scoreboard (best of 5?)

### What have you accomplished so far?

* Added a background image to our canvas
* Created the Map playing area with boundaries
* Created the Tile class
* Created an initial grid
* Created test suite

## Instructor Section

### Points for first check in (base 50)
55 (+5 for All The Tests!)

### Instructor's goals for next check in
Goals for Thursday:
- Collision detection (blocks, bombs, explosions)
- Have a Bomber Person on screen that can be moved around with arrow keys
- Bomb and explosion class written, not necessarily rendering on screen

### Feedback?
Great idea to use sprites for character graphics.
