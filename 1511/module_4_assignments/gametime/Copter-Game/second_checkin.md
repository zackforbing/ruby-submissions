### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In
- graphic for helicopter
- style "buildings" and  "clouds" (top and bottom barriers)
- style start button so it is the Most Beautiful Button
- score counter & leader boards
- increased difficulty (speed + number of obstacles)
- music


### Possible extensions (not required but nice to have):
- enable copter to gain ability to shoot and destroy obstacles

### Feedback?
- possible extension ideas: rather than two be player, have moving enemy trying to shoot you down & you have to shoot them, or changing to Danger Theme which makes it harder (maybe you hit a bad obstacles because it puts you into the danger theme, but you can get out of it). Hero mode vs. Danger mode.
